        <h2>HE IS "HIM"</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Clutch Machine – When the world is watching and the pressure is sky-high, Ronaldo delivers. Hat-trick against Atlético, last-minute winners — he lives for the big stage.</li>
          <li>Numbers Don’t Lie – All-time top scorer for club and country, 5 Ballon d’Ors, 800+ career goals. Records fear him more than defenders do.</li>
          <li>Relentless Mentality – From a skinny kid in Madeira to the king of world football — nobody outworks Ronaldo. His grind is unmatched. His confidence? Earned.</li>
